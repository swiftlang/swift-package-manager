Calling `ByteString.validDescription` on `contents` is also [inefficient, and possibly incorrect](https://github.com/apple/swift-tools-support-core/blob/8f9838e5d4fefa0e12267a1ff87d67c40c6d4214/Sources/TSCBasic/ByteString.swift#L121). However, this is a one-time thing for each package manifest, and almost necessary in order to work with all Unicode line-terminators. We probably can improve its efficiency and correctness by using `URL` for the file's path, and get is content via `Foundation.String(contentsOf:encoding:)`.

        //
        // 2. Check that everything in the Swift tools version specification up to the version specifier is formatted correctly according to the relaxed rules since Swift 5.4. Backward-compatibility is not considered here, because the user-specified version is unknown yet.
        //
        //    1. Check that the comment marker is formatted correctly.
        //
        //    2. Check that the label is formatted correctly
        //
        //    3. Check that there is no unforeseen formatting error in the Swift tools version specification up to the version specifier.
        //
        // 3. Check that the version spicier is formatted correctly.
        //
        // 4. Check that the manifest is formatted backward-compatibly, if the user-specified version is < 5.4. Backward-compatibility checks are now possible, because the user-specified version has become known since the previous step.
        //
        //    1. Check that the manifest's leading whitespace is backward-compatible with Swift < 5.4.
        //
        //    2. Check that the spacing after the comment marker in the Swift tools version specification is backward-compatible with Swift < 5.4.
        //
        //    3. Check that the spacing after the label in the Swift tools version specification is backward-compatible with Swift < 5.4.
        //
        // This order is based on the general idea that a manifest's readability should come before its validity when being diagnosed. The package manager must first understand what is written in the manifest before it can tell if anything is wrong. This idea is manifested (no pun intended) in 2 areas of the diagnosis process:
        //
        // 1. The version specifier contains the most important piece of information, but it's checked last in the Swift tools version specification. This happens twice: both in checking its existence and in checking its correctness.
        //
        //    This is because the package manager must be confident that the version specifier it sees is exactly what the user has provided, not polluted by anything that comes before it. With English written left-to-right, and the manifest parsed largely left-to-right, errors in the comment marker and the label could be mistaken by the package manager as the version specifier's. Consider the following Swift tools version specification, where an "l" is mistyped with "1":
        //
        //        // swift-too1s-version: 5.3
        //
        //    Were the version specifier checked before everything else, the package manager will mistake "1s-version: 5.3" as the version specifier, treating the typo in the label as an error in the version specifier. The user will likely be confused, when informed by the diagnostics message that the version specifier is misspelt.
        //
        //    With the label checked before the version specifier, the diagnosis can be more precise, and this kind of confusion to the user can be avoided.
        //
        // 2. Backward-compatibility checks of the manifest are after the formatting checks of the Swift tools version specification, not during them.
        //
        //    Although it makes more sense, form a human's perspective, if the backward-compatibility checks is integrated within the formatting checks, the package manager can not see things as holistically as a human does. It can not pinpoint all errors in the manifest simultaneously, or understand the user's intention when the manifest has formatting errors, let alone finding any backward-incompatibility. It is better to first ensure that the manifest is formatted correctly according to the latest rules, then compare it against old rules to find backward-incompatibilities.

        //
        // The task that remains is to identify and record the following well defined components: a label, a version specifier, and an optional spacing between the label and the version specifier. However, because of the countless misspellings there could be, it's virtually impossible to teach SwiftPM to perfectly tell where the label ends and where the version specifier begins, without making the logic too complex.
        //
        // Let's explore this problem starting from a well-formed Swift tools version specification, because it's the only invariable that we can rely on. The current `Substring`-based strategy depends on landmarks that sit on either the `startIndex` or the `endIndex` of a component. We already know where the label starts, and it's trivial to find where the version specifier ends (its terminator is well-defined), so all that we need look for now are the `endIndex` of the label and the `startIndex` of the version specifier. In a well-formatted Swift tools version specification, the label ends with a ":", and the version specifier starts with a digit. Let's see how these 2 landmarks fare with some examples:
        //
        // 1. A well-formatted Swift tools version specification
        //
        //        // swift-tools-version: 5.4
        //
        //    The `endIndex` of the label can be clearly identified with the first ":", and the `startIndex` of the version specifier can be clearly identified with the first digit "5".
        //
        // 2. A misspelt label with a digit within:
        //
        //        // swift-too1s-version: 5.4
        //    The `endIndex` of the label can be identified with the first ":"; the `startIndex` of the version specifier can be identified with the digit "5", if and only if the search for the first ":" takes precedence.
        //
        // 3. A misspelt label with a colon and a digit within:
        //
        //        // sw:ft-too1s-version: 5.4
        //
        //    The `endIndex` of the label can be identified with the last ":";  the `startIndex` of the version specifier can be identified with the digit "5", if and only if the search for the last ":" takes precedence.
        //
        // Between example 2 and 3, the rules are already conflicting. Although the examples above are purposely constructed to illustrate the ineffectiveness of using ":" and digits to locate the label and the version specifier, it's undeniable a human can flawlessly point out where the labels and version specifiers are at a glance. There are more examples that shows it's even harder to find a one-size-fits-all landmark-based rule than illustrated above:
        //
        //     // swift-too1s-version:-5.4
        //     // swift-too1s-version 5:4:0
        //     // swift tools version 5-4-1
        //     // swift-tools-version: S.A.I
        //     // swift-tools-version::5.4
        //     ...
        //
        // One useful information we can glean from these examples is that using both ":" and digits as landmarks doesn't work, so it's better to stick with just one of them and ignore the other. Because the version specifier is the more important component than the label is, the current implementation of this function searches for the first numerical character in the sequence to prioritize the identification of the version specifier. The ":"-first approach isn't completely abandoned, either: If the sequence is prefixed with "swift-tools-version:" (case-insensitive), then we can be mostly certain that the user has provided a well-formatted label, and use the position past that of the first ":" in the sequence as the `startIndex` of the label. There are still countless label misspellings that begin with "swift-tools-version:", but since for all of them, the misspelt part comes after the well-formed part, in the interest of keeping the logic relatively straightforward, the labels' misspellings in this sort of situation are carried over as the version specifiers'.
        //
        // Although it's possible to replace the landmark-based logic altogether with a fuzzy matching-based approach or some heuristics, it overly complicates this function. Even if a more advanced method is applied at the expense of high complexity, it's still unlikely to be perfect. Maybe someone can find better solution without incurring much additional cost.

        /// If the label begins with exactly `"swift-tools-version:"`, then this position is right after the `":"`'s. Otherwise, it's the position of the first horizontal whitespace character since the spacing after the comment marker (if there is a spacing between the label and the version specifier) or the `startIndex` of the version specifier (if there is no spacing between the label and the version specifier).
