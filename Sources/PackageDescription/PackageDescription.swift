/// The configuration of a Swift package.
///
/// Pass configuration options as parameters to your package's initializer
/// statement to provide the name of the package, its targets, products,
/// dependencies, and other configuration options.
///
/// By convention, you need to define the properties of a package in a single
/// nested initializer statement. Don't modify it after initialization. The
/// following package manifest shows the initialization of a simple package
/// object for the MyLibrary Swift package:
///
/// ```swift
/// // swift-tools-version:5.3
/// import PackageDescription
///
/// let package = Package(
///     name: "MyLibrary",
///     platforms: [
///         .macOS(.v10_15),
///     ],
///     products: [
///         .library(name: "MyLibrary", targets: ["MyLibrary"])
///     ],
///     dependencies: [
///         .package(url: "https://url/of/another/package/named/utility", from: "1.0.0")
///     ],
///     targets: [
///         .target(name: "MyLibrary", dependencies: ["Utility"]),
///         .testTarget(name: "MyLibraryTests", dependencies: ["MyLibrary"])
///     ]
/// )
/// ```
///
/// In Swift tools versions earlier than 5.4, the package manifest must begin with the string `// swift-tools-version:`
/// followed by a version number specifier. Version 5.4 and later has relaxed the whitespace requirements.
/// The following code listing shows a few examples of valid declarations of the Swift tools version:
///
/// ```swift
/// // swift-tools-version:3.0.2
/// // swift-tools-version:3.1
/// // swift-tools-version:4.0
/// // swift-tools-version:5.3
/// // swift-tools-version: 5.6
/// ```
///
/// The Swift tools version declares the version of the `PackageDescription`
/// library, the minimum version of the Swift tools and Swift language
/// compatibility version to process the manifest, and the required minimum
/// version of the Swift tools to use the Swift package. Each version of Swift
/// can introduce updates to the PackageDescription framework, but the previous
/// API version is available to packages which declare a prior tools version.
/// This behavior means you can take advantage of new releases of Swift, the Swift
/// tools, and the PackageDescription library, without having to update your
/// package's manifest or losing access to existing packages.
