# Enable a command plugin

@Metadata {
    @Available("Swift", introduced: "5.6")
}

Extend package manager commands with a command plugin from another package.

## Overview

To get access to a plugin from another package, add a dependency on the package that provides the plugin.
This lets the package access any plugins from the dependency.

### Add a dependency

For example, to enable the plugins from [swift-docc-plugin](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc-plugin), add it as a dependency:

```swift
let package = Package(
    // name, platforms, products, etc.
    dependencies: [
        // other dependencies
        .package(url: "https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc-plugin",
                 from: "1.0.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        // targets
    ]
)
```

### View available plugins

Run `swift package plugin --list` to see available plugins.
For full documentation on the plugin command, see <doc:PackagePlugin>.

Invoke an available plugin using `swift package` followed by the plugin, and provide any parameters or options required.
For example, the following command invokes the `generate-documentation` command from [swift-docc-plugin](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-docc-plugin).

```bash
swift package generate-documentation
```

### Pass arguments and flags to the plugin

Package manager passes all command line arguments and flags after the invocation verb to the plugin.

For example, if your package has multiple targets you may want to specify a single target with the parameter: `--target`.
An updated example that previews the hypothetical target `MyTarget`:

```bash
swift package generate-documentation --target MyTarget
```

### Exempting sandbox constraints

Command plugins that need to write to the file system cause package manager to ask the user for approval if `swift package` is invoked from a console, or deny the request if it is not.
Pass the flag `--allow-writing-to-package-directory` to the `swift package` invocation to allow the request without questions â€” this is particularly useful in a Continuous Integration environment.

Similarly, use the `--allow-network-connections` flag to allow network connections without showing a prompt.
