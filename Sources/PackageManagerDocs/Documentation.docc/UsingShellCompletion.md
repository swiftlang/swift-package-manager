# Using shell completion scripts

<!--@START_MENU_TOKEN@-->Summary<!--@END_MENU_TOKEN@-->

## Overview

SwiftPM ships with completion scripts for both Bash and ZSH. These files should be generated in order to use them.

### Bash

Use the following commands to install the Bash completions to `~/.swift-package-complete.bash` and automatically load them using your `~/.bash_profile` file.

```bash
swift package completion-tool generate-bash-script > ~/.swift-package-complete.bash
echo -e "source ~/.swift-package-complete.bash\n" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.swift-package-complete.bash
```

Alternatively, add the following commands to your `~/.bash_profile` file to directly load completions:

```bash
# Source Swift completion
if [ -n "`which swift`" ]; then
    eval "`swift package completion-tool generate-bash-script`"
fi
```

### ZSH

Use the following commands to install the ZSH completions to `~/.zsh/_swift`. You can chose a different folder, but the filename should be `_swift`. This will also add `~/.zsh` to your `$fpath` using your `~/.zshrc` file.

```bash
mkdir ~/.zsh
swift package completion-tool generate-zsh-script > ~/.zsh/_swift
echo -e "fpath=(~/.zsh \$fpath)\n" >> ~/.zshrc
compinit
```
