Add a new collection.

## Overview

This subcommand adds a package collection hosted on the web (HTTPS required):

```bash
$ swift package-collection add https://www.example.com/packages.json
Added "Sample Package Collection" to your package collections.
```

Or found in the local file system:

```bash
$ swift package-collection add file:///absolute/path/to/packages.json
Added "Sample Package Collection" to your package collections.
```

The optional `order` hint can be used to order collections and may potentially influence ranking in search results:

```bash
$ swift package-collection add https://www.example.com/packages.json [--order N]
Added "Sample Package Collection" to your package collections.
```

### Signed package collections

Publishers of a package collection may [sign a collection to protect its contents](<doc:PackageCollections#Protecting-package-collections>). 
The package manager will check if a signed collection's signature is valid before importing it. 
If the validation check fails, the package manager returns an error:

```bash
$ swift package-collection add https://www.example.com/bad-packages.json
The collection's signature is invalid. If you would like to continue please rerun command with '--skip-signature-check'.
```

Users may continue adding the collection despite the error or preemptively skip the signature check on a package collection by passing the `--skip-signature-check` flag:

```bash
$ swift package-collection add https://www.example.com/packages.json --skip-signature-check
```

For package collections hosted on the web, publishers may ask the package manager to [enforce the signature requirement](<doc:PackageSecurity#Trusted-root-certificates>). 
If a package collection is expected to be signed but it isn't, users will see the following error message:

```bash
$ swift package-collection add https://www.example.com/bad-packages.json
The collection is missing required signature, which means it might have been compromised.
```

Users should NOT add the package collection in this case.

For more details on signature validation, see <doc:PackageSecurity#Signed-package-collections>.

##### Trusted root certificates

The package manager [validates the certificate](<doc:PackageSecurity#Trusted-root-certificates>) of a signed collection as a part of its signature validation to make sure that the root certificate is trusted.

```bash
$ swift package-collection add https://www.example.com/packages.json
The collection's signature cannot be verified due to missing configuration.
```

Users can explicitly specify they trust a publisher and any collections they publish, by obtaining that publisher's root certificate and saving it to `~/.swiftpm/config/trust-root-certs`. The 
root certificates must be DER-encoded. Since the package manager trusts all certificate chains under a root, depending on what roots are installed, some publishers may already be trusted implicitly and users don't need to explicitly specify each one. 

#### Unsigned package collections

Users will get an error when trying to add an unsigned package collection:

```bash
$ swift package-collection add https://www.example.com/packages.json
The collection is not signed. If you would still like to add it please rerun 'add' with '--trust-unsigned'.
```

To continue, users must confirm their trust by passing the `--trust-unsigned` flag:

```bash
$ swift package-collection add https://www.example.com/packages.json --trust-unsigned
```

The `--skip-signature-check` flag has no effects on unsigned collections.
