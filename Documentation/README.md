# Swift Package Manager

The documentation previously included here has primarily been migrated into DocC format, and is available for viewing online at Swift.org [Package Manager Docs](https://docs.swift.org/swiftpm/documentation/packagemanagerdocs).

For documentation on developing the Swift Package Manager itself, see the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

This directory continues to retain legacy [design notes](Design), [release notes](ReleaseNotes), details about
the [Package Registry API](PackageRegistry), and [libSwiftPM](libSwiftPM).
