# `Package.swift` — The Manifest File

Instructions for how to build a package are provided by
a manifest file, called `Package.swift`.
You can customize this file to
declare build targets or dependencies,
include or exclude source files,
and specify build configurations for the module or individual files.

Here's an example of a `Package.swift` file:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Hello",
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "ssh://git@example.com/Greeter.git", versions: "1.0.0"),
    ]
)
```

A `Package.swift` file a Swift file
that declaratively configures a Package
using types defined in the `PackageDescription` module.
This manifest declares a dependency on an external package: `Greeter`.

If your package contains multiple targets that depend on each other you will
need to specify their interdependencies. Here is an example:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Example",
    targets: [
        Target(
            name: "top",
            dependencies: [.Target(name: "bottom")]),
        Target(
            name: "bottom")
```

The targets are named how your subdirectories are named.
