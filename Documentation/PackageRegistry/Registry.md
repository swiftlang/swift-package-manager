## 1. Notations

The following terminology and conventions are used in this document.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation
as described in [RFC 5234]
and Unicode regular expression syntax
as described in [Unicode Technical Standard #18][UAX18].

API endpoints that accept parameters in their path
are expressed by Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) templates,
as described in [RFC 6570].

## 2. Definitions

The following terms, as used in this document, have the meanings indicated.

- _Package_:
  A named collection of Swift source code
  that is organized into one or more modules
  according to a `Package.swift` manifest file.
- _Scope_:
  A logical grouping of related packages assigned by a package registry.
- _Release_:
  The state of a package after applying a particular set of changes
  that is uniquely identified by an assigned version number.
- _Version Number_:
  An identifier for a package release
  in accordance with the [Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer)][SemVer].
- _Precedence_:
  The ordering of version numbers relative to each other
  as defined by the [Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer)][SemVer].

## 3. Conventions

This document uses the following conventions
in its description of client-server interactions.

### 3.1. Application layer protocols

A client and server MUST communicate over a secured connection
using Transport Layer Security (TLS) with the `https` URI scheme.

The use of HTTP 1.1 in examples is non-normative.
A client and server MAY communicate according to this specification
using any version of the HTTP protocol.

### 3.2. Authentication

A server MAY require authentication
for client requests to access information about packages and package releases.

A server SHOULD respond with a status code of `401` (Unauthorized)
if a client sends a request to an endpoint that requires authentication
without providing credentials.
A server MAY respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found) or `403` (Forbidden)
when a client provides valid credentials
but isn't authorized to access the requested resource.

A server MAY use any authentication model of its choosing.
However, the use of a scoped, revocable authorization framework
like [OAuth 2.0][RFC 6749] is RECOMMENDED.

### 3.3. Error handling

A server MUST communicate any errors to the client
using "problem details" objects,
as described by [RFC 7807].
For example,
a client sends a request for a nonexistent release of a package
and receives the following response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 404
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
   "detail": "release not found"
}
```

### 3.4. Rate limiting

A server MAY limit the number of requests made by a client
by responding with a status code of `429` (Too Many Requests).

```http
HTTP/1.1 429
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en
Retry-After: 60

{
   "detail": "try again in 60 seconds"
}
```

A client SHOULD follow the guidance of any
`Retry-After` header values provided in responses
to prevent overwhelming a server with retry requests.
It is RECOMMENDED for clients to introduce random jitter in their retry logic
to avoid a [thundering herd effect].

### 3.5. API versioning

Package registry APIs are versioned.

API version numbers are designated by decimal integers.
The accepted version of this proposal constitutes the initial version, `1`.
Subsequent revisions SHOULD be numbered sequentially
(`2`, `3`, and so on).

API version numbers SHOULD follow
Semantic Versioning conventions for major releases.
Non-breaking changes, such as
adding new endpoints,
adding new optional parameters to existing endpoints,
or adding new information to existing endpoints in a backward-compatible way,
SHOULD NOT require a new version.
Breaking changes, such as
removing or changing an existing endpoint
in a backward-incompatible way,
MUST correspond to a new version.

A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header field
to specify the API version of a request.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList/list HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json
```

Valid `Accept` header field values are described by the following rules:

```abnf
    version     = "1"       ; The API version
    mediatype   = "json" /  ; JSON (default media type)
                  "zip"  /  ; Zip archives, used for package releases
                  "swift"   ; Swift file, used for package manifest
    accept      = "application/vnd.swift.registry" [".v" version] ["+" mediatype]
```

A server MUST set the `Content-Type` header field
with the corresponding content type of the response. 

A server MUST set the `Content-Version` header field
with the API version number of the response, unless 
explicitly stated otherwise. 

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Version: 1
```

If a client sends a request without an `Accept` header,
a server MAY either respond with a status code of `400 Bad Request` or
process the request using an API version that it chooses,
making sure to set the `Content-Type` and `Content-Version` headers accordingly.

If a client sends a request with an `Accept` header
that specifies an unknown or invalid API version,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `400` (Bad Request).

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
   "detail": "invalid API version"
}
```

If a client sends a request with an `Accept` header
that specifies a valid but unsupported API version,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `415` (Unsupported Media Type).

```http
HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
   "detail": "unsupported API version"
}
```

### 3.6. Package identification

A package may declare external packages as dependencies in its manifest.
Each package dependency may specify a requirement
on which versions are allowed.

An external package dependency may itself have
one or more external package dependencies,
known as <dfn>transitive dependencies</dfn>.
When multiple packages have dependencies in common,
Swift Package Manager determines which version of that package should be used
(if any exist that satisfy all specified requirements)
in a process called <dfn>package resolution</dfn>.

Each external package is uniquely identified
by a scoped identifier in the form `scope.package-name`.

#### 3.6.1 Package scope

A *scope* provides a namespace for related packages within a package registry.
A package scope consists of alphanumeric characters and hyphens.
Hyphens may not occur at the beginning or end,
nor consecutively within a scope.
The maximum length of a package scope is 39 characters.
A valid package scope matches the following regular expression pattern:

```regexp
\A[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9]|-(?=[a-zA-Z0-9])){0,38}\z
```

Package scopes are case-insensitive
(for example, `mona` ‚âç `MONA`).

#### 3.6.2. Package name

A package's *name* uniquely identifies a package in a scope.
A package name consists of alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens.
Hyphens and underscores may not occur at the beginning or end,
nor consecutively within a name.
The maximum length of a package name is 100 characters.
A valid package name matches the following regular expression pattern:

```regexp
\A[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9]|[-_](?=[a-zA-Z0-9])){0,99}\z
```

Package names are case-insensitive
(for example, `LinkedList` ‚âç `LINKEDLIST`).

## 4. Endpoints

A server MUST respond to the following endpoints:

| Link                 | Method | Path                                                      | Description                                       |
| -------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [\[1\]](#endpoint-1) | `GET`  | `/{scope}/{name}`                                         | List package releases                             |
| [\[2\]](#endpoint-2) | `GET`  | `/{scope}/{name}/{version}`                               | Fetch metadata for a package release              |
| [\[3\]](#endpoint-3) | `GET`  | `/{scope}/{name}/{version}/Package.swift{?swift-version}` | Fetch manifest for a package release              |
| [\[4\]](#endpoint-4) | `GET`  | `/{scope}/{name}/{version}.zip`                           | Download source archive for a package release     |
| [\[5\]](#endpoint-5) | `GET`  | `/identifiers{?url}`                                      | Lookup package identifiers registered for a URL   |
| [\[6\]](#endpoint-6) | `PUT`  | `/{scope}/{name}/{version}`                               | Create a package release                          |

A server SHOULD also respond to `HEAD` requests
for each of the specified endpoints.

A client MAY send an `OPTIONS` request with an asterisk (`*`)
to determine the permitted communication options for the server.
A server MAY respond with a `Link` header containing
an entry for the `service-doc` relation type
with a link to this document, and
an entry for the `service-desc` relation type
with a link to the OpenAPI specification.

* * *

<a name="endpoint-1"></a>

### 4.1. List package releases

A client MAY send a `GET` request
for a URI matching the expression `/{scope}/{name}`
to retrieve a list of the available releases for a particular package.
A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header with the value
`application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json`
and MAY append the `.json` extension to the requested URI.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json
```

If a package is found at the requested location,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the `Content-Type` header `application/json`.
Otherwise, a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found).

A server SHOULD respond with a JSON document
containing the releases for the requested package.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Version: 1
Content-Length: 508
Link: <https://github.com/mona/LinkedList>; rel="canonical",
      <ssh://git@github.com:mona/LinkedList.git>; rel="alternate",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1>; rel="latest-version",
      <https://github.com/sponsors/mona>; rel="payment"

{
    "releases": {
        "1.1.1": {
            "url": "https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1"
        },
        "1.1.0": {
            "url": "https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.0",
            "problem": {
                "status": 410,
                "title": "Gone",
                "detail": "this release was removed from the registry"
            }
        },
        "1.0.0": {
            "url": "https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.0.0"
        }
    }
}
```

The response body MUST contain a JSON object
nested at a top-level `releases` key,
whose keys are version numbers for releases and
whose values are objects containing the following fields:

| Key       | Type   | Description                           | Requirement Level |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `url`     | String | The location of the release resource. | OPTIONAL          |
| `problem` | Object | A [problem details][RFC 7807] object. | OPTIONAL          |

A server MAY specify a URL for a release using the `url` key.
A client SHOULD locate a release using the value of the `url` key, if one is provided.
Otherwise, the client SHOULD locate a release
by expanding the URI Template `/{scope}/{name}/{version}` on the originating host.

A server SHOULD communicate the unavailability of a package release
using a ["problem details"][RFC 7807] object.
A client SHOULD consider any releases with an associated `problem`
to be unavailable for the purposes of package resolution.

A server SHOULD respond with
a link to the highest precedence published release of the package if one exists,
using a `Link` header field with a `latest-version` relation.

A server SHOULD list releases in order of precedence,
starting with the highest precedence version.
However, a client SHOULD NOT assume
any specific ordering of versions in a response.

A server MAY include a `Link` entry
with the `canonical` relation type
that locates the source repository of the package.

A server MAY include one or more `Link` entries
with the `alternate` relation type
for other source repository locations.

A server MAY paginate results by responding with
a `Link` header field that includes any of the following relations:

| Name    | Description                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `next`  | The immediate next page of results.     |
| `last`  | The last page of results.               |
| `first` | The first page of results.              |
| `prev`  | The immediate previous page of results. |

For example,
the `Link` header field in a response for the third page of paginated results:

```http
Link: <https://packages.example.com/mona/HashMap/5.0.3>; rel="latest-version",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/HashMap?page=1>; rel="first",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/HashMap?page=2>; rel="previous",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/HashMap?page=4>; rel="next",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/HashMap?page=10>; rel="last"
```

A server MAY respond with additional `Link` entries,
such as one with a `payment` relation for sponsoring a package maintainer.

<a name="endpoint-2"></a>

### 4.2. Fetch information about a package release

A client MAY send a `GET` request
for a URI matching the expression `/{scope}/{name}/{version}`
to retrieve information about a release.
A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header with the value
`application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json`,
and MAY append the `.json` extension to the requested URI.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList/1.1.1 HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json
```

If a release is found at the requested location,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the `Content-Type` header `application/json`.
Otherwise, a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found).

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 720
Link: <https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1>; rel="latest-version",
      <https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.0.0>; rel="predecessor-version"
{
  "id": "mona.LinkedList",
  "version": "1.1.1",
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "source-archive",
      "type": "application/zip",
      "checksum": "a2ac54cf25fbc1ad0028f03f0aa4b96833b83bb05a14e510892bb27dea4dc812",
      "signing": {
        "signatureBase64Encoded": "l1TdTeIuGdNsO1FQ0ptD64F5nSSOsQ5WzhM6/7KsHRuLHfTsggnyIWr0DxMcBj5F40zfplwntXAgS0ynlqvlFw==",
        "signatureFormat": "cms-1.0.0"
      }
    }
  ],
  "metadata": { ... },
  "publishedAt": "2023-02-16T04:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The response body SHOULD contain a JSON object containing the following fields:

| Key           | Type   | Description                               | Required |
| ------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- | :------: |
| `id`          | String | The namespaced package identifier.        | ‚úì |
| `version`     | String | The package release version number.       | ‚úì |
| `resources`   | Array  | The resources available for the release.  | ‚úì |
| `metadata`    | Object | Additional information about the release. | ‚úì |
| `publishedAt` | String | The [ISO 8601]-formatted datetime string of when the package release was published, as recorded by the registry. See related [`originalPublicationTime`](#appendix-b---package-release-metadata-json-schema) in `metadata`. | |

A server SHOULD respond with a `Link` header containing the following entries:

| Relation              | Description                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `latest-version`      | The highest precedence published release of the package                              |
| `successor-version`   | The next published release of the package ordered by precedence, if one exists       |
| `predecessor-version` | The previously published release of the package ordered by precedence, if one exists |

A link with the `latest-version` relation
MAY correspond to the requested release.

#### 4.2.1. Package release resources

Each element in the `resources` array is a JSON object with the following keys:

| Key        | Type    | Description                                                                |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`     | String  | The name of the resource.                                                  |
| `type`     | String  | The content type of the resource.                                          |
| `checksum` | String  | A hexadecimal representation of the SHA256 digest for the resource.        |
| `signing`  | Object  | Information about the signature. Required only if the resource is signed.  |

The `signing` JSON object contains these keys:

| Key                      | Type    | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `signatureBase64Encoded` | String  | The resource's signature, base64 encoded.         |
| `signatureFormat`        | String  | The signature format. (e.g., `cms-1.0.0`)         |

A resource object SHOULD have one of the following combinations of
`name` and `type` values:

| Name               | Content Type      | Description                        |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `source-archive`   | `application/zip` | An archive of package sources.     |

A release MUST NOT have more than a single resource object
with a given combination of `name` and `type` values.

#### 4.2.2. Package release metadata standards

[Appendix B](#appendix-b---package-release-metadata-json-schema) 
defines the JSON schema for package release metadata that
gets submitted as part of the ["create a package release"](#endpoint-6)
request. A server MAY allow and/or populate additional metadata by 
expanding the schema. The `metadata` key in the 
["fetch information about a package release "](#endpoint-2) API response
will hold the user-provided as well as the server populated metadata.

<a name="endpoint-3"></a>

### 4.3. Fetch manifest for a package release

A client MAY send a `GET` request for a URI matching the expression
`/{scope}/{name}/{version}/Package.swift`
to retrieve the package manifest for a release.
A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header with the value
`application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+swift`.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList/1.1.1/Package.swift HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+swift
```

If a release is found at the requested location,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the `Content-Type` header `text/x-swift`.
Otherwise, a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found).

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, immutable
Content-Type: text/x-swift
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="Package.swift"
Content-Length: 361
Content-Version: 1
Link: <http://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1/Package.swift?swift-version=4>; rel="alternate"; filename="Package@swift-4.swift"; swift-tools-version="4.0",
      <http://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1/Package.swift?swift-version=4.2>; rel="alternate"; filename="Package@swift-4.2.swift"; swift-tools-version="4.0"

// swift-tools-version:5.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "LinkedList",
    products: [
        .library(name: "LinkedList", targets: ["LinkedList"])
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "LinkedList"),
        .testTarget(name: "LinkedListTests", dependencies: ["LinkedList"]),
    ],
    swiftLanguageVersions: [.v4, .v5]
)
```

A server SHOULD respond with a `Content-Length` header
set to the size of the manifest in bytes.

A server SHOULD respond with a `Content-Disposition` header
set to `attachment` with a `filename` parameter equal to
the name of the manifest file
(for example, "Package.swift").

A server MAY omit the `Content-Version` header
since the response content (i.e., the manifest) SHOULD NOT
change across different API versions.

It is RECOMMENDED for clients and servers to support
caching as described by [RFC 7234].

A server MUST include a `Link` header field
with a value for each version-specific package manifest file
in the release's source archive,
whose filename matches the following regular expression pattern:

```regexp
\APackage@swift-(\d+)(?:\.(\d+))?(?:\.(\d+))?.swift\z
```

Each link value SHOULD have the `alternate` relation type,
a `filename` attribute set to the version-specific package manifest filename
(for example, `Package@swift-4.swift`), and
a `swift-tools-version` attribute set to the [Swift tools version]
specified by the package manifest file
(for example, `4.0` for a manifest beginning with the comment
`// swift-tools-version:4.0`).

#### 4.3.1. swift-version query parameter

A client MAY specify a `swift-version` query parameter
to request a manifest for a particular version of Swift.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList/1.1.1/Package.swift?swift-version=4.2 HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+swift
```

If the package includes a file named
`Package@swift-{swift-version}.swift`,
the server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the content of that file in the response body.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: public, immutable
Content-Type: text/x-swift
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="Package@swift-4.2.swift"
Content-Length: 361
Content-Version: 1

// swift-tools-version:4.2
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "LinkedList",
    products: [
        .library(name: "LinkedList", targets: ["LinkedList"])
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(name: "LinkedList"),
        .testTarget(name: "LinkedListTests", dependencies: ["LinkedList"]),
    ],
    swiftLanguageVersions: [.v3, .v4]
)
```

Otherwise,
the server SHOULD respond with a status code of `303` (See Other)
and redirect to the unqualified `Package.swift` resource.

```http
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Content-Version: 1
Location: https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1/Package.swift
```

<a name="endpoint-4"></a>

### 4.4. Download source archive

A client MAY send a `GET` request
for a URI matching the expression `/{scope}/{name}/{version}.zip`
to retrieve a release's source archive.
A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header with the value
`application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+zip`
and MUST append the `.zip` extension to the requested path.

```http
GET /mona/LinkedList/1.1.1.zip HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+zip
```

If a release is found at the requested location,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the `Content-Type` header `application/zip`.
Otherwise, a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found).

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Cache-Control: public, immutable
Content-Type: application/zip
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="LinkedList-1.1.1.zip"
Content-Length: 2048
Content-Version: 1
Digest: sha-256=oqxUzyX7wa0AKPA/CqS5aDO4O7BaFOUQiSuyfepNyBI=
Link: <https://mirror-japanwest.example.com/mona-LinkedList-1.1.1.zip>; rel=duplicate; geo=jp; pri=10; type="application/zip"
X-Swift-Package-Signature-Format: cms-1.0.0
X-Swift-Package-Signature: l1TdTeIuGdNsO1FQ0ptD64F5nSSOsQ5WzhM6/7KsHRuLHfTsggnyIWr0DxMcBj5F40zfplwntXAgS0ynlqvlFw==
```

A server MUST respond with a `Content-Length` header
set to the size of the archive in bytes.
A client SHOULD terminate any requests whose response exceeds
the expected content length.

A server MAY respond with a `Digest` header
containing a cryptographic digest of the source archive.

A server SHOULD respond with a `Content-Disposition` header
set to `attachment` with a `filename` parameter equal to the name of the package
followed by a hyphen (`-`), the version number, and file extension
(for example, "LinkedList-1.1.1.zip").

A server MAY omit the `Content-Version` header
since the response content (i.e., the source archive) SHOULD NOT
change across different API versions.

It is RECOMMENDED for clients and servers to support
range requests as described by [RFC 7233]
and caching as described by [RFC 7234].

If a release is signed, a server MUST include 
`X-Swift-Package-Signature-Format` and `X-Swift-Package-Signature`
headers in the response.

#### 4.4.1. Integrity verification

A client MUST verify the integrity of a downloaded source archive using
the `checksum` value for the associated `source-archive` resource
in the response to `GET /{scope}/{name}/{version}`,
as described in [4.2.1](#421-package-release-resources).

A client SHOULD also verify the integrity using any values
provided in the `Digest` header of the source archive response
(for using the command
`shasum -b -a 256 LinkedList-1.1.1.zip | cut -f1 | xxd -r -p | base64`).

#### 4.4.2. Download locations

A server MAY specify mirrors or multiple download locations
using `Link` header fields
with a `duplicate` relation,
as described by [RFC 6249].
A client MAY use this information
to determine its preferred strategy for downloading.

A server MAY respond with a status code of `303` (See Other)
to redirect the client to download the source archive from another host.
The client MUST NOT follow redirects that downgrade to an insecure connection.
The client SHOULD limit the number of redirects to prevent a redirect loop.

For example,
a server redirects the client to download from
a content delivery network (CDN) using a signed URL:

```http
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Location: https://example.cdn.com/LinkedList-1.1.1.zip?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

```http
GET /LinkedList-1.1.1.zip?key=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX HTTP/1.1
Host: example.cdn.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+zip
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Cache-Control: public, immutable
Content-Type: application/zip
Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="LinkedList-1.1.1.zip"
Content-Length: 2048
Content-Version: 1
Digest: sha-256=a2ac54cf25fbc1ad0028f03f0aa4b96833b83bb05a14e510892bb27dea4dc812
```

#### 4.4.3. Signature validation

A client MUST validate the signature of a signed archive
according to the signature format and configuration. Signing
information can alternatively be found in the associated 
`source-archive` resource in the response to `GET /{scope}/{name}/{version}`,
as described in [4.2.1](#421-package-release-resources).

<a name="endpoint-5"></a>

### 4.5. Lookup package identifiers registered for a URL

A client MAY send a `GET` request
for a URI matching the expression `/identifiers?url={url}`
to retrieve package identifiers associated with a particular URL.
A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header with the value
`application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json`.

```http
GET /identifiers?url=https://github.com/mona/LinkedList HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1
```

A client MUST provide a URL for the `url` query parameter.
When no `url` parameter is specified,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `400` (Bad Request).

If one or more package identifiers are associated with the specified URL,
a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `200` (OK)
and the `Content-Type` header `application/json`.
Otherwise, a server SHOULD respond with a status code of `404` (Not Found).

A server SHOULD respond with a JSON document
containing the package identifiers for the specified URL.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Version: 1

{
    "identifiers": [
      "mona.LinkedList"
    ]
}
```

The response body MUST contain an array of package identifier strings
nested at a top-level `identifiers` key.

It is RECOMMENDED for clients and servers to support
caching as described by [RFC 7234].

#### 4.5.1 URL to package identifier mappings

As part of the [package release metadata](#422-package-release-metadata-standards)
JSON object, the `repositoryURLs` array can be used to specify 
URLs associated with a package identifier. This is one way 
through which a server can obtain URL to package identifier 
mappings for this API. 

A server MAY choose other mechanism(s) for package authors 
to specify these mappings.

A server SHOULD validate the package author's ownership claim
on the corresponding repository.

<a name="endpoint-6"></a>

### 4.6. Create a package release

A client MAY send a `PUT` request
for a URI matching the expression
`/{scope}/{name}/{version}`
to publish a release of a package.
A client MUST provide a body encoded as multipart form data
with the following sections:

| Key                        | Content-Type               | Description                               | Requirement Level |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `source-archive`           | `application/zip`          | The source archive of the package.        | REQUIRED          |
| `source-archive-signature` | `application/octet-stream` | The signature of the source archive.      | OPTIONAL          |
| `metadata`                 | `application/json`         | Additional information about the release. | OPTIONAL          |
| `metadata-signature`       | `application/octet-stream` | The signature of the metadata.            | OPTIONAL          |

A client MUST set a `Content-Type` header with the value 
`multipart/form-data`. `boundary` can be any string.

A client MAY use any valid value (e.g., `binary`) for the
`Content-Transfer-Encoding` header.

A client SHOULD set the `Content-Length` header with 
the total size of the body in bytes.

A client SHOULD set the `Accept` header with the value
`application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json`.

A client MUST set a `X-Swift-Package-Signature-Format` header 
with the signature format if the source archive is signed.

```http
PUT /mona/LinkedList/1.1.1 HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1+json
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary="boundary"
Content-Length: 336
Expect: 100-continue
X-Swift-Package-Signature-Format: cms-1.0.0

M6TdTeIuGdNsO1FQ0ptD64F5nSSOsQ5WzhM6/7KsHRuLHfTsggnyIWr0DxMcBj5F40zfplwntXAgS0ynlqvlFw==

```

A server SHOULD require a client to perform authentication
for any requests to create a package release.
Use of multi-factor authentication is RECOMMENDED.

A client MAY publish releases in any order.
For example,
if a package has existing `1.0.0` and `2.0.0` releases,
a client MAY publish a new `1.0.1` or `1.1.0` release.

Once a release has been published,
any resources associated with that release,
including its source archive,
MUST NOT change.

If a release already exists for a package at the specified version,
the server SHOULD respond with a status code of `409` (Conflict).

```http
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
   "detail": "a release with version 1.0.0 already exists"
}
```

It is RECOMMENDED that a server institute policies
for publishing new releases of a package
after a scope is transferred to a new owner.
For example,
the next release of an existing package is published with a new major version,
or only after a period of 45 days after transfer.

If the client provides an `Expect` header,
a server SHOULD check that the request can succeed
before responding with a status code of `100 (Continue)`.
A server that doesn't support expectations
SHOULD respond with a status code of `417 (Expectation Failed)`.
In response,
a client MAY remove the `Expect` header and retry the request.

```http
HTTP/1.1 417 (Expectation Failed)
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
   "detail": "expectations aren't supported"
}
```

Support for this endpoint is OPTIONAL.
A server SHOULD indicate that publishing isn't supported
by responding with a status code of `405` (Method Not Allowed).

```http
HTTP/1.1 405 (Method Not Allowed)
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
   "detail": "publishing isn't supported"
}
```

A server MAY respond either synchronously or asynchronously.
For more information,
see [4.6.4](#464-synchronous-and-asynchronous-publication).

#### 4.6.1. Source archive

A client MUST include a multipart section named `source-archive`
containing the source archive for a release.
A client SHOULD set a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/zip`
and a `Content-Length` header with the size of the Zip archive in bytes.

```http
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="source-archive"
Content-Type: application/zip
Content-Length: 32
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

gHUFBgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==
```

A client SHOULD use the `swift package archive-source` tool
to create a source archive for the release.

A server MAY analyze a package to
assess its viability,
perform security testing,
or otherwise evaluate software quality.
A server MAY refuse to publish a package release for any reason
by responding with a status code of `422` (Unprocessable Entity).

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
   "detail": "package doesn't contain a valid manifest (Package.swift) file"
}
```

A server SHOULD use the `swift package compute-checksum` tool
to compute the checksum that's provided in response to
a client's subsequent request to [download the source archive](#endpoint-4)
for the release.

#### 4.6.2. Package release metadata

A client MAY include a multipart section named `metadata`
containing additional information about the release.
A client SHOULD set a `Content-Type` header with the value `application/json`
and a `Content-Length` header with the size of the JSON document in bytes.
The package release metadata MUST be based on the [JSON schema](#appendix-b---package-release-metadata-json-schema),
as discussed in [4.2.2](#422-package-release-metadata-standards).

```http
--boundary
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="metadata"
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 226
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

{
  "description": "One thing links to another.",
  "repositoryURLs": ["https://github.com/mona/LinkedList"],
  "licenseURL": "https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0",
  "author": {
      "name": "Mona Lisa Octocat"
  }
}

```

A server MAY allow and/or populate additional metadata for a release.

A server MAY make any properties in the [JSON schema](#appendix-b---package-release-metadata-json-schema)
and additional metadata it defines required.

If a client provides an invalid JSON document,
the server SHOULD respond with a status code of
`422` (Unprocessable Entity) or `413` (Payload Too Large)
and MAY communicate validation error details in the response body.

```http
HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en

{
   "detail": "invalid JSON provided for release metadata"
}
``` 

#### 4.6.3. Synchronous and asynchronous publication

A server MAY respond to a request to publish a new package release
either synchronously or asynchronously.

A client MAY indicate their preference for asynchronous processing
with a `Prefer` header field containing the token `respond-async`
and an optional `wait` preference,
as described by [RFC 7240].

```http
PUT /mona/LinkedList/1.1.1 HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1
Prefer: respond-async, wait=300
```

##### 4.6.3.1. Synchronous publication

If processing is done synchronously,
the server MUST respond with a status code of `201` (Created)
to indicate that the package release was published.
This response SHOULD also contain
a `Location` header with a URL to the new release.

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Version: 1
Location: https://packages.example.com/github.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1
```

A client MAY set a timeout to guarantee a timely response to each request.

##### 4.6.3.2. Asynchronous publication

If processing is done asynchronously,
the server MUST respond with a status code of `202` (Accepted)
to acknowledge that the request is being processed.
This response MUST contain a `Location` header
with a URL that the client can poll for progress updates
and SHOULD contain a `Retry-After` header
with an estimate of when processing is expected to finish.
A server MAY locate the status resource endpoint at a URI of its choosing.
However,
the use of a non-sequential, randomly-generated identifier is RECOMMENDED.

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Version: 1
Location: https://packages.example.com/submissions/90D8CC77-A576-47AE-A531-D6402C4E33BC
Retry-After: 120
```

A client MAY send a `GET` request
to the location provided by the server in response to a publish request
to see the current status of that process.

```http
GET /submissions/90D8CC77-A576-47AE-A531-D6402C4E33BC HTTP/1.1
Host: packages.example.com
Accept: application/vnd.swift.registry.v1
```

If the asynchronous publish request is still processing,
the server SHOULD respond with a status code of `202` (Accepted) and
a `Retry-After` header with an estimate of when processing should finish.
A server MAY include additional details in the response body.

```http
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/json
Retry-After: 120

{
  "status": "Processing (2/3 steps complete)",
  "steps": {
    {"name": "Validate metadata", "status": "complete"},
    {"name": "Verify package manifest", "status": "complete"},
    {"name": "Scan for vulnerabilities", "status": "pending"}
  }
}
```

If the asynchronous publish request is finished processing successfully,
the server SHOULD respond with a status code of `301` (Moved Permanently)
and a `Location` header with a URL to the package release.

```http
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Content-Version: 1
Location: https://packages.example.com/mona/LinkedList/1.1.1
```

If the asynchronous publish request failed,
the server SHOULD respond with an appropriate client error status code (`4xx`).

```http
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en
Location: https://packages.example.com/submissions/90D8CC77-A576-47AE-A531-D6402C4E33BC

{
   "detail": "invalid package"
}
```

A client MAY send a `DELETE` request
to the location provided by the server in response to a publish request
to cancel that process.

If a request to publish a new package release were to fail,
a server MUST communicate that failure in the same way
if sending an immediate response
as it would if responding to a client polling for status.

If a client makes a request to publish a package release
to a server that is asynchronously processing a request to publish that release,
the server MUST respond with a status code of `409` (Conflict)

```http
HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
Content-Version: 1
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Content-Language: en
Location: https://packages.example.com/submissions/90D8CC77-A576-47AE-A531-D6402C4E33BC

{
   "detail": "already processing a request to publish this package version"
}
```

If a client makes a request to publish a package release
to a server that finished processing a failed request to publish that release,
the server SHOULD try publishing that release again.
A server MAY refuse to fulfill a subsequent request to publish a package release
by responding with a status code of `409` (Conflict).

##### `PackageRelease` type

| Property                  | Type                | Description                                      | Required |
| ------------------------- | :-----------------: | ------------------------------------------------ | :------: |
| `author`                  | [Author](#author-type) | Author of the package release. | |
| `description`             | String | A description of the package release. | |
| `licenseURL`              | String | URL of the package release's license document. | |
| `originalPublicationTime` | String | Original publication time of the package release in [ISO 8601] format. This can be set if the package release was previously published elsewhere.<br>A registry should record the publication time independently and include it as `publishedAt` in the [package release metadata response](#42-fetch-information-about-a-package-release). <br>In case both `originalPublicationTime` and `publishedAt` are set, `originalPublicationTime` should be used. | |
| `readmeURL`       | String | URL of the README specifically for the package release or broadly for the package. | |
| `repositoryURLs`  | Array | Code repository URL(s) of the package. It is recommended to include all URL variations (e.g., SSH, HTTPS) for the same repository. This can be an empty array if the package does not have source control representation.<br/>Setting this property is one way through which a registry can obtain repository URL to package identifier mappings for the ["lookup package identifiers registered for a URL" API](Registry.md#45-lookup-package-identifiers-registered-for-a-url). A registry may choose other mechanism(s) for package authors to specify such mappings. | |

##### `Author` type
