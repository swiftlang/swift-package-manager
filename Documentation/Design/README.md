# Swift Package Manager Design Docs

Swift Package Manager design is done in open source, and governed by Swift Evolution process.
As such, you can find up-to-date Swift Package Manager design docs in https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/tree/main/proposals.

This directory contains documentation on the engineering design decisions and internals of the Swift Package Manager, outside the evolution process.
