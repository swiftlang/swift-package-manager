# SwiftPM 6.3 Release Notes

## SwiftBuild: Official Preview of Next-Generation Build System

SwiftPM 6.3 introduces the official preview of **SwiftBuild**.

SwiftBuild is designed to replace the current native build system and brings several key improvements:

- TODO

### Trying SwiftBuild

You can opt into the preview build system using the `--build-system` flag:

```
# Use SwiftBuild for building
swift build --build-system swiftbuild

# Use SwiftBuild for testing
swift test --build-system swiftbuild

# Use SwiftBuild for running executables
swift run --build-system swiftbuild MyExecutable
```

The native build system remains the default and continues to be fully supported. We encourage developers to try SwiftBuild and [provide feedback](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/issues) on their experience.

For more information about SwiftBuild, including known limitations and platform-specific issues, see the [SwiftBuild Preview documentation](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Sources/PackageManagerDocs/Documentation.docc/SwiftBuildPreview.md). Additional details about the underlying build system are available in the [SwiftBuild repository](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-build).

## Improved Build Plugin Support for C Interoperability

SwiftPM build plugins can now automatically generate API notes, module maps, and header files for C-family targets, making it easier to create Swift packages that wrap C libraries with idiomatic Swift **APIs.**

TODO Example

This functionality is available in **both** the native build system and SwiftBuild preview.

## Symbol Graph Generation: Control Over Inherited Documentation

Command plugins that generate symbol graphs (such as documentation generators) can now control whether inherited documentation is included, providing better flexibility for different documentation styles.

TODO Example

## Package Traits: Improved Discoverability

A new `swift package show-traits` command makes it easier to discover and understand the traits supported by a package and its dependencies.

### Usage

View all traits available in your package:

```
# Show traits for the current package
swift package show-traits

# Show traits for a specific package dependency
swift package show-traits MyDependency
```

## Other Improvements

SwiftPM 6.3 includes numerous bug fixes and performance improvements across the build system, dependency resolution, and plugin infrastructure. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for a complete list of changes.
