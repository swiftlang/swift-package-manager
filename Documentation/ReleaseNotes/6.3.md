# SwiftPM 6.3 Release Notes

## SwiftBuild: Preview of Next-Generation Build System

SwiftBuild is being developed to replace the current native build system and brings several key improvements.  Packages that build successfully with the existing native (default) build system should build with SwiftBuild without requiring changes to your `Package.swift` or source code.  

For more information, including known limitations and platform-specific issues, see the [SwiftBuild Preview documentation](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Sources/PackageManagerDocs/Documentation.docc/SwiftBuildPreview.md).


### Trying SwiftBuild

You can preview the build system using the `--build-system` flag:

```
# Use SwiftBuild for building
swift build --build-system swiftbuild

# Use SwiftBuild for testing
swift test --build-system swiftbuild

# Use SwiftBuild for running executables
swift run --build-system swiftbuild MyExecutable
```

The native build system remains the default and continues to be fully supported. We encourage developers to try SwiftBuild and [provide feedback](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/issues) on their experience.

## Improved Build Plugin Support for C Interoperability

SwiftPM build plugins can now automatically generate API notes, module maps, and header files for C-family targets, making it easier to create Swift packages that wrap C libraries.

This functionality is available in **both** the native build system and SwiftBuild.

## Symbol Graph Generation: Control Over Inherited Documentation

Command plugins that generate symbol graphs can now control whether inherited documentation is included, providing better flexibility for different documentation styles.

## Package Traits: Improved Discoverability

A new `swift package show-traits` command makes it easier to discover the traits supported by a package.
