# SwiftPM 6.3 Release Notes

## SwiftBuild: Preview of Next-Generation Build System

SwiftBuild is being developed to replace the current native build system and brings several key improvements.  You can read more about SwiftBuild [here](https://www.swift.org/blog/the-next-chapter-in-swift-build-technologies/).


### Trying SwiftBuild

You can preview the build system using the `--build-system` flag:

```
# Use SwiftBuild for building
swift build --build-system swiftbuild

# Use SwiftBuild for testing
swift test --build-system swiftbuild

# Use SwiftBuild for running executables
swift run --build-system swiftbuild MyExecutable
```

The native build system remains the default and continues to be fully supported. We encourage developers to try SwiftBuild and [provide feedback](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/issues) on their experience.

For more information, including known limitations and platform-specific issues, see the [SwiftBuild Preview documentation](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Sources/PackageManagerDocs/Documentation.docc/SwiftBuildPreview.md).

## Improved Build Plugin Support for C Interoperability

SwiftPM build plugins can now automatically generate API notes, module maps, and header files for C-family targets, making it easier to create Swift packages that wrap C libraries.

This functionality is available in **both** the native build system and SwiftBuild.

## Symbol Graph Generation: Control Over Inherited Documentation

Command plugins that generate symbol graphs can now control whether inherited documentation is included, providing better flexibility for different documentation styles.

## Package Traits: Improved Discoverability

A new `swift package show-traits` command makes it easier to discover the traits supported by a package.
